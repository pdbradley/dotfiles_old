.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB$gcloud compute instances set\-scheduling\fR is used to configure scheduling
options for Google Compute Engine virtual machines.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

\fINAME\fR
.RS 2m
The name of the instance.


.RE

.SH "FLAGS"

\fB\-\-maintenance\-policy\fR=\fIMAINTENANCE_POLICY\fR
.RS 2m
Specifies the behavior of the instances when their host machines undergo
maintenance. The default is MIGRATE. \fIMAINTENANCE_POLICY\fR must be one of:

\fBMIGRATE\fR
.RS 2m
The instances should be migrated to a new host. This will temporarily impact the
performance of instances during a migration event.
.RE
\fBTERMINATE\fR
.RS 2m
The instances should be terminated.

.RE
.RE
\fB\-\-restart\-on\-failure\fR
.RS 2m
The instances will be restarted if they are terminated by Compute ' Engine. This
does not affect terminations performed by the user.'. Use
\fB\-\-no\-restart\-on\-failure\fR to disable.

.RE
\fB\-\-zone\fR=\fIZONE\fR
.RS 2m
The zone of the instance to operate on. If not specified, you will be prompted
to select a zone.

To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
\f5\fIcompute/zone\fR\fR property:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE
.RE

A list of zones can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute zones list
.RE

To unset the property, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config unset compute/zone
.RE

Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
\f5\fICLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE\fR\fR.


.RE

.SH "GLOBAL FLAGS"

Run \fB$ gcloud help\fR for a description of flags available to all commands.
